# filter-gen
A tool for designing and implementing analog filters and generating associated files for use with EDA software and/or SPICE variants.

## EDA Targets
KiCad is currently the only target EDA software, with an option to generate files for standalone use or as hierarchical sheets.

## Contribution
Contributions from others to the project are welcome, and I will try to look at any pull requests in a timely fashion and keep issues up-to-date.
